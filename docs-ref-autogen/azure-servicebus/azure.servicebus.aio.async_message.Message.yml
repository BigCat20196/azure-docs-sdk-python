    or processing. The queue can also be configured to send expired messages to the
    Dead Letter queue.

    or

    *SubscriptionClient.get_deadletter_receiver()*.'

    mode are not

    locked, and therefore cannot be renewed. This operation can also be performed
    as an asynchronous

    background task by registering the message with an *azure.servicebus.aio.AutoLockRenew*
    instance.

    This operation is only available for non-sessionful messages.'
