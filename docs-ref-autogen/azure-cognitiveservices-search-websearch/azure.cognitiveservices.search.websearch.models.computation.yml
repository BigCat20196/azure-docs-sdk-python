  - name: expression
    description: 'Required. The math or conversion expression. If the

      query contains a request to convert units of measure (for example, meters

      to feet), this field contains the from units and value contains the to

      units. If the query contains a mathematical expression such as 2+2, this

      field contains the expression and value contains the answer. Note that

      mathematical expressions may be normalized. For example, if the query was

      sqrt(4^2+8^2), the normalized expression may be sqrt((4^2)+(8^2)). If the

      user''s query is a math question and the textDecorations query parameter is

      set to true, the expression string may include formatting markers. For

      example, if the user''s query is log(2), the normalized expression includes

      the subscript markers. For more information, see Hit Highlighting.'
