summary: "A default credential capable of handling most Azure SDK authentication scenarios.\n\
  \nThe identity it uses depends on the environment. When an access token is needed,\
  \ it requests one using these\nidentities in turn, stopping when one provides a\
  \ token:\n\n1. A service principal configured by environment variables. See <xref:azure.identity.EnvironmentCredential>\
  \ for more details. \n\n2. An Azure managed identity. See <xref:azure.identity.ManagedIdentityCredential>\
  \ for more details. \n\n3. On Windows only: a user who has signed in with a Microsoft\
  \ application, such as Visual Studio. If multiple identities are in the cache, then\
  \ the value of  the environment variable `AZURE_USERNAME` is used to select which\
  \ identity to use. See <xref:azure.identity.SharedTokenCacheCredential> for more\
  \ details. \n\n4. The user currently signed in to Visual Studio Code. \n\n5. The\
  \ identity currently logged in to the Azure CLI. \n\nThis default behavior is configurable\
  \ with keyword arguments."
