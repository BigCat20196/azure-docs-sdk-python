summary: 'Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a

  desired output bitrate layer.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: H264Layer


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
constructor:
  syntax: VideoLayer(**kwargs)
  parameters:
  - name: width
    description: 'The width of the output video for this layer. The value can

      be absolute (in pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means

      the output video has half as many pixels in width as the input.'
    types:
    - '[str](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str)'
  - name: height
    description: 'The height of the output video for this layer. The value

      can be absolute (in pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50%

      means the output video has half as many pixels in height as the input.'
    types:
    - '[str](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str)'
  - name: label
    description: 'The alphanumeric label for this layer, which can be used in

      multiplexing different video and audio layers, or in naming the output

      file.'
    types:
    - '[str](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str)'
  - name: odatatype
    description: Required. Constant filled by server.
    types:
    - '[str](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str)'
  - name: bitrate
    description: 'The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode

      the input video when generating this layer. This is a required field.'
    types:
    - '[int](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#int)'
  - name: max_bitrate
    description: 'The maximum bitrate (in bits per second), at which the

      VBV buffer should be assumed to refill. If not specified, defaults to the

      same value as bitrate.'
    types:
    - '[int](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#int)'
  - name: b_frames
    description: 'The number of B-frames to be used when encoding this

      layer.  If not specified, the encoder chooses an appropriate number based

      on the video profile and level.'
    types:
    - '[int](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#int)'
  - name: frame_rate
    description: 'The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to

      encode this layer. The value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are

      integers (For example, 30000/1001), or in the form of a number (For

      example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints on allowed frame

      rates based on the profile and level. If it is not specified, the encoder

      will use the same frame rate as the input video.'
    types:
    - '[str](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str)'
  - name: slices
    description: 'The number of slices to be used when encoding this layer.

      If not specified, default is zero, which means that encoder will use a

      single slice for each frame.'
    types:
    - '[int](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#int)'
  - name: adaptive_bframe
    description: 'Whether or not adaptive B-frames are to be used

      when encoding this layer. If not specified, the encoder will turn it on

      whenever the video profile permits its use.'
    types:
    - '[bool](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#bool)'
