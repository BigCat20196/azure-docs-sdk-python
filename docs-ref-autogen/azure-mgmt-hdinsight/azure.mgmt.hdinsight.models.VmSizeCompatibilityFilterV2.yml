summary: 'This class represent a single filter object that defines a multidimensional

  set. The dimensions of this set are Regions, ClusterFlavors, NodeTypes and

  ClusterVersions. The constraint should be defined based on the following:

  FilterMode (Exclude vs Include), VMSizes (the vm sizes in affect of

  exclusion/inclusion) and the ordering of the Filters. Later filters

  override previous settings if conflicted.'
