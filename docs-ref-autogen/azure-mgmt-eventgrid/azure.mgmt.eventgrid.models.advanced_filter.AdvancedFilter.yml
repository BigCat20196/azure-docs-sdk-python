summary: 'This is the base type that represents an advanced filter. To configure an

  advanced filter, do not directly instantiate an object of this class.

  Instead, instantiate an object of a derived class such as

  BoolEqualsAdvancedFilter, NumberInAdvancedFilter,

  StringEqualsAdvancedFilter etc. depending on the type of the key based on

  which you want to filter.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: NumberInAdvancedFilter, NumberNotInAdvancedFilter,

  NumberLessThanAdvancedFilter, NumberGreaterThanAdvancedFilter,

  NumberLessThanOrEqualsAdvancedFilter,

  NumberGreaterThanOrEqualsAdvancedFilter, BoolEqualsAdvancedFilter,

  StringInAdvancedFilter, StringNotInAdvancedFilter,

  StringBeginsWithAdvancedFilter, StringEndsWithAdvancedFilter,

  StringContainsAdvancedFilter
