        and report to it.

        - Deploying - Indicates that the Service Fabric runtime is being installed

        on the VMs. Cluster resource will be in this state until the cluster boots

        up and system services are up.

        - BaselineUpgrade - Indicates that the cluster is upgrading to establishes

        the cluster version. This upgrade is automatically initiated when the

        cluster boots up for the first time.

        - UpdatingUserConfiguration - Indicates that the cluster is being upgraded

        with the user provided configuration.

        - UpdatingUserCertificate - Indicates that the cluster is being upgraded

        with the user provided certificate.

        - UpdatingInfrastructure - Indicates that the cluster is being upgraded

        with the latest Service Fabric runtime version. This happens only when the

        cannot be managed by the Resource Provider.
