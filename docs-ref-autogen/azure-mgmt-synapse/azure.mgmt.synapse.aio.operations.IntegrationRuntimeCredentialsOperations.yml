  summary: 'Sync integration runtime credentials.


    Force the integration runtime to synchronize credentials across integration runtime
    nodes, and

    this will override the credentials across all worker nodes with those available

    manually

    import it (preferred) on any self-hosted integration runtime node than using this
    API directly.'
