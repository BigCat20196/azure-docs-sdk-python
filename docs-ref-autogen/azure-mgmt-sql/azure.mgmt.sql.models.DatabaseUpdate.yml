    description: 'Specifies the mode of database creation.

      Default: regular database creation.

      Copy: creates a database as a copy of an existing database.

      sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the source

      database.

      Secondary: creates a database as a secondary replica of an existing

      database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the

      existing primary database.

      PointInTimeRestore: Creates a database by restoring a point in time backup

      of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the

      resource ID of the existing database, and restorePointInTime must be

      specified.

      Recovery: Creates a database by restoring a geo-replicated backup.

      sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the recoverable database resource ID

      to restore.

      Restore: Creates a database by restoring a backup of a deleted database.

      sourceDatabaseId must be specified. If sourceDatabaseId is the database''s

      original resource ID, then sourceDatabaseDeletionDate must be specified.

      Otherwise sourceDatabaseId must be the restorable dropped database

      resource ID and sourceDatabaseDeletionDate is ignored. restorePointInTime

      may also be specified to restore from an earlier point in time.

      RestoreLongTermRetentionBackup: Creates a database by restoring from a

      long term retention vault. recoveryServicesRecoveryPointResourceId must be

      specified as the recovery point resource ID.

      Copy, Secondary, and RestoreLongTermRetentionBackup are not supported for
