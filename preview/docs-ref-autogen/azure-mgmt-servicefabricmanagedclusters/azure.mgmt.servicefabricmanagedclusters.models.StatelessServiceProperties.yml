      upgrade and

      disabling node. The endpoint exposed on this instance is removed prior to starting
      the delay,

      service endpoint change

      events(https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.servicemanagementclient.registerservicenotificationfilterasync),

      can do the following upon receiving the endpoint removal notification: - Stop
      sending new

      requests to this instance. - Close existing connections after in-flight requests
      have

      completed. - Connect to a different instance of the service partition for future
      requests.

      Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDuration is 0, which indicates
      that there won''t be

      any delay or removal of the endpoint prior to closing the instance.'
