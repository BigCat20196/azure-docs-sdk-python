    We have helper methods to create requests specific to this service in *azure.purview.scanning.rest*.

    Use these helper methods to create the request you pass to this method. See our
    example below:



    ```


    >>> from azure.purview.scanning.rest import build_get_request

    >>> request = build_get_request(key_vault_name)

    <HttpRequest [GET], url: ''/azureKeyVaults/{keyVaultName}''>

    >>> response = client.send_request(request)

    <HttpResponse: 200 OK>

    ```
