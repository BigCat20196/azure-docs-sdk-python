    description: 'Duration in seconds, to

      wait before a stateless instance is closed, to allow the active requests

      to drain gracefully. This would be effective when the instance is closing

      during the application/cluster

      configured in the service description. See

      InstanceCloseDelayDurationSeconds property in $ref:

      "#/definitions/StatelessServiceDescription.yaml" for details.

      Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds is

      4294967295, which indicates that the behavior will entirely depend on the

      delay configured in the stateless service description.'
