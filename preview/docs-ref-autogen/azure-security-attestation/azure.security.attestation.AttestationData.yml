summary: 'AttestationData represents an object passed as an input to the Attestation
  Service.


  AttestationData comes in two forms: Binary and JSON. To distinguish between the
  two, when an <xref:azure.security.attestation.AttestationData>

  object is created, the caller provides an indication that the input binary data
  will be treated as either JSON or Binary.


  The AttestationData is reflected in the generated <xref:azure.security.attestation.AttestationResult>
  in two possible ways.

  If the AttestationData is Binary, then the AttestationData is reflected in the AttestationResult.enclave_held_data
  claim.

  If the AttestationData is JSON, then the AttestationData is expressed as JSON in
  the AttestationResult.runtime_claims or AttestationResult.inittime_claims claim.'
